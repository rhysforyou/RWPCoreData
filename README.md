# RWPCoreData

Core Data is a great framework, but there's a lot of boilerplate code
necessary for even the simplest of projects. RWPCoreData simplifies
this greatly, allowing you to initialise managed objects with `init`,
managing a global main context, and enabling you to easily synchronise
data with remote APIs.
